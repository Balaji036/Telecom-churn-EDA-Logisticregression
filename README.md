# Telecom-churn-EDA-Logisticregression

A telecom company wants to predict which of its customers are likely to churn (i.e., cancel their subscription) in the near future. The company has collected a dataset of historical customer data, including demographic information, usage patterns, and customer support interactions, for a large number of customers who either churned or remained with the company.

The company wants to use this data to build a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are at high risk of churning, so that the company can take proactive steps to retain these customers.

To accomplish this, the company plans to use logistic regression, a machine learning technique that can model the probability of a binary outcome (churn or no churn) as a function of multiple predictor variables. The company will use the historical data to train the model, and then apply the model to new customer data to make predictions about which customers are likely to churn.

The ultimate goal of this project is to reduce churn rates and improve customer retention, which should have a positive impact on the company's bottom line.
